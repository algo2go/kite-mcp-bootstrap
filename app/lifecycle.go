// LifecycleManager owns the ordered teardown of background workers wired
// during initializeServices. It exists for two reasons:
//
//  1. Single source of truth — before this type, the same teardown sequence
//     was hand-maintained in four places (wire.go's success-defer, app.go's
//     RunServer error-path defer, http.go's setupGracefulShutdown, and
//     helpers_test.go's cleanupInitializeServices). They had drifted
//     (wire.go was missing outboxPump, telegramBot, oauthHandler, rateLimiters,
//     and metrics shutdowns) — a class of bug that goroutine-leak audits
//     surface as "background worker still running after test exit".
//
//  2. Wire/fx amenability — a forthcoming DI container migration (Investment A
//     in .research/agent-concurrency-decoupling-plan.md) needs lifecycle
//     OUTSIDE the constructor graph. Wire generates straight-line
//     construction with no cleanup-on-failure; fx has lifecycle hooks but
//     adds runtime DI tax. Either way, by the time the DI container
//     replaces parts of initializeServices, the lifecycle order will
//     already live in one place — this struct — and not need to be
//     re-encoded from scratch.
//
// Contract:
//   - Append registers a stop func. The order of Append calls determines
//     the order of Shutdown invocation: FIRST appended runs FIRST on
//     teardown. Callers append in the order workers are started, which
//     mirrors the production setupGracefulShutdown sequence.
//   - Shutdown invokes every registered stop in append order, recovering
//     from panics so a buggy stop function cannot block the rest. Idempotent
//     via sync.Once — safe to call from both the success-defer in
//     initializeServices AND the graceful-shutdown handler in http.go.
//   - Each registered stop function MUST be idempotent itself (typically
//     sync.Once-guarded or nil-checked) — Shutdown does not double-guard
//     individual stops.
//
// Non-goals:
//   - Concurrent Shutdown: not designed for parallel teardown. Each stop
//     runs synchronously to preserve ordering semantics (e.g., HTTP server
//     drains before audit store stops, otherwise in-flight requests
//     enqueue audit entries after the writer has stopped).
//   - Error aggregation: stop funcs return error but Shutdown logs and
//     continues. A stop failure does not abort the rest of the chain.
// LOGGER MIGRATION (Wave D Phase 3 Logger sweep — app/ Package 7)
//
// `logger` is typed as the kc/logger.Logger port (logport.Logger). The
// LifecycleManager runs the Shutdown chain on a one-shot path with no
// inbound request ctx; each runOne() call passes context.Background()
// to the logger so the trace-correlation seam is explicit even though
// no upstream ctx exists at this seam.
//
// Construction: NewLifecycleManagerWithPort is the canonical
// constructor; it accepts a logport.Logger directly. The legacy
// *slog.Logger shim was retired in Wave D Phase 3 Package 8 cleanup
// after the call-site migration sweep.

// Append registers a named stop function. Order matters: first appended
// runs first on Shutdown. Pass a name purely for log-surface readability
// when a stop fails or panics.
//
// fn may return error or nil; nil-returning stops are valid for one-shot
// channels (Cancel(), close(ch)). The name is logged on panic recovery
// so an operator can pinpoint a buggy stop without a stack search.
//
// Safe to call concurrently with other Appends but NOT with Shutdown
// (Shutdown takes a read snapshot under the mutex; appending during
// shutdown produces undefined ordering).

// sync.Once — calling from both the error-path defer AND the
// graceful-shutdown signal handler is safe; the second call is a no-op.
//
// Panics in individual stop funcs are recovered and logged; the chain
// continues. An error returned by a stop func is logged but does not
// abort the chain — every later stop still runs. This is the right
// posture for graceful-shutdown: a partial failure (e.g., DB busy
// during audit-store stop) should still let the HTTP server drain and
// the OS reclaim the rest of the process.
